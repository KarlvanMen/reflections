What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A Git repositary is created. So I can follow along the changes made in the future.



How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is a middle man between both. It offers a nice way to update all changed files in one go instead of seperate steps.



How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

Check out the status and see which files are affected, the do diff or diff --staged for comparison between earlier versions before submitting



What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

They are both merged. Deleted lines in one file from the original are deleted, while added are combined.



What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?

Automatic makes it fast, while manual work would avoid conflicts
